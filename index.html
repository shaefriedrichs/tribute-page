        <h3>Background info</h3>
        <p>In 2014, Ed was scrolling the BBC news when the headline <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-27405467" target="_blank"><i>Hundreds of chickens killed in M62 lorry
            crash</i></a> grabbed his attention. He was stunned to read that 1,500 chickens had been killed in a truck
          crash, with many of those chickens being killed from being run over by cars as they wandered out into the
          road.</p>
        <p>As well as those who had died, there were hundreds more with broken wings and bones, their bodies crushed and
          twisted. Ed thought to himself about how much pain and suffering these animals must be in. And then it dawned
          on him. The animals we eat have the capacity to suffer, and therefore they wish to live a life free from
          suffering. His mind went to the fridge, inside which was a leftover KFC from his dinner the previous night.
        </p>
        <p>And so in that moment Ed faced an ultimatum, does he continue living in a way that causes suffering to
          animals and takes their life from them, or does he live in alignment with the values of being against animal
          cruelty and unnecessary suffering that like everyone, he said he had?</p>

          <h3>Current activism and impact</h3>
          <p>In early 2016, Ed released the documentary <i>Land of Hope and Glory</i>, which served as a conclusive exposé of
            UK land animal farming. His university speech “You Will Never Look at Your Life in the Same Way Again” went
            viral in early 2018 and to date has 35 million views.</p>
          <p>Ed has spoken at over 1/3 of UK universities and has taught as a guest lecturer at Harvard University. He
            has given speeches across the world, including at 6 Ivy League colleges, EPFL, Facebook, The Economist, and
            Google. Ed has additionally given two TEDx talks and has debated numerous times on live television and
            radio, and has been featured on the BBC, ITV and LadBible.</p>
          <p>He also opened Unity Diner in 2018, a non-profit vegan restaurant in London where the profits go directly
            back into helping animals. In December 2020 Ed announced that he and his team had founded Surge Sanctuary, a
            forever home for abused and unwanted animals.</p>
          <p>In 2021, Ed wrote his debut book <a href="https://www.penguin.co.nz/books/this-is-vegan-propaganda-9781785043765" target="_blank"><i>This is Vegan Propaganda (And Other Lies the Meat Industry Tells You)</i></a>,
            becoming an instant best-seller. Ed also co-founded The No Catch Co. in 2021, an ethical vegan company
            taking on the traditional model of a British fish and chip shop.</p>
